I used react+vite & tailwind, plan to include axios - start project in terminal with "npm run dev".

To create a react+vite app, use "create react vite@latest" in terminal in your project folder.

Once react has been installed, tailwind info can be configured following instructions here:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

Lookup Tailwind syntax for css shorthand used for inline css properties to use in react:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
